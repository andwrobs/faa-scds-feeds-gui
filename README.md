# FAA SCDS Feeds GUI

A browser application that implements a geo-filtering algorithm to dynamically generate topic subscriptions that attract pre-filtered sets of streaming GPS data from SCDS feeds.

This GUI displays data produced by [SWIM Feed Handler](https://github.com/solacese/swim-feed-handler), an application designed to relay messages from the FAA's publicly available US System Wide Information Management (SWIM) data feeds to a Solace PubSub+ Event Broker. The SWIM Feed Handler GitHub repository includes a thorough overview of the steps required to sign up with the FAA to receive SCDS data and to run the application locally.

## Public URL

[https://solacese.github.io/faa-scds-feeds-gui/](https://solacese.github.io/faa-scds-feeds-gui/)

## Branch structure

- **master**: source code for the site hosted at the above public URL
- **kdb-stats**: includes a panel to display stats produced by an accompanying project, [scds-solace-kdb](https://github.com/solacese/scds-solace-kdb)

## Run locally

First, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solacese/faa-scds-feeds-gui.git
cd faa-scds-feeds-gui
npm i
```

Then, edit `solace.config.js` and `google-maps.config.js`. The Google Maps API key included in this repository is restricted to this application's [public URL](https://solacese.github.io/faa-scds-feeds-gui/), so you'll need your own if you want to develop locally. You can do this by following along [Google's instructions for getting a Maps JavaScript API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).

Once the connection details and access key are configured, you can run the app using [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

If you navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) you should see the app running.

The `src` directory is being watched, so if you save a file and reload your browser you will see the changes.

Note: there's a small bug with sirv's dev server restarts, and sometimes the console will show that the app is being served to localhost:5001 while it is bundling. It will switch to localhost:5000 when it finishes bundling or sometimes on reload, so be a little patient and it should be fine. The visual glitch didn't affect my development experience at all, but if your app isn't being served successfully on localhost:5000, please add an issue to this repository.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

## Build and deploy

The build command is...

```bash
npm run build

```

...and the publish directory is `public`.

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies`.
